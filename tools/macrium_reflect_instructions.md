# Macrium Reflect Instructions

## Instructions

1. Download and install the Macrium Reflect software.
2. Ensure both the source drive and the target drive are connected to your computer.
3. Verify the destination drive has enough space to hold all the data from the source drive.
4. Launch the Macrium Reflect software and start the clone process by selecting the source drive and the target drive.
5. Select the partitions to be cloned. If needed, adjust the size and order of these partitions to fit the new drive if it has a different capacity.

7. Review the operation summary, save the backup option as an XML file for future use, and start the cloning process.
8. Monitor the progress; it takes a considerable amount of time depending on the amount of data.
9. Once the cloning is done, test the drive by scanning the data and ensuring it works perfectly.
10. Disconnect the drives from the computer after confirming the cloned drive is working fine.
